For our project we took everyones favorite video game loadup screens and 3D projected them. We started off with the gamecube
load up screen. We wanted to put up a exact gamecube cut out, but because the gamecube loadup is constantly moving we dicided
that it would look much better if we just cut out the border of it and let it move the way it wants while still outlining our
cutout. After that we started working on the Playstation 2 loadup screen. We noticed that there was a moment of blackness where
we felt that would be a good time for us to cut into the Gamecube loadup. We didn't make any cutouts for the Playstation 2
loadup because they were not only moving around but they were rotating and spining in place, we thought that it would be best
not to put the cutouts in because they would look slopy and unsatisfying. We got a lot of guidence from the coad from you and 
the unity help website. Once we figured out how to use the two sorces of information we typed up and it worked, kinda. It worked
for the most part but everytime we switch videos there is a slight white screen.
