My project will utilze the IMEI info API to confirm that the user's phone arent's stollen or are still being paid off. How it 
will work is the game scene will have a textbox where users enter the IMEI number on from their phones and then submit it. From there 
the API will conduct the phone's information and if everything checks out it will display a graphic of a cell phone on screen 
congradulating the user. if it doesnt check out then there will be a sad face graphic. All other information can be displayed on the
console.

I have some familarity on how to bring the link for the API into the code.
I need assistance in creating a text box in the game scene and making the API work incase I miss some details. I will also need help 
in making a trigger to pop up the the two different graphics.
